# Stream. Curating your streams #

![logo](https://github.com/rijal10/stream/blob/master/logo/250%20PX.png)

> With Stream you can create and collaborate in moments.

Stream helps you to create - build - and collaborate across streams of content. Create your first stream or many streams, build them up, or dispose of them when you need to.

Stream is a great way to manage large amounts of content and channels, from Social Networks, to blogs and websites. Stream is set to challenge the norm.

"Just say stream..."

## Looking for our legacy code? ##
[git clone -b legacy-code --single-branch https://github.com/puffstream/stream.git](https://github.com/puffstream/stream/tree/legacy-code)

### What happened to the previous code? ###
What's that quote? 1 step back, 2 steps forward? That's the one. Before I can really charge ahead with the Stream Software, I need to have a clear understanding of what Stream is, what it isn't. For example, Stream isn't a News feed. I think that's one of the main issues with the legacy code was that it was still conforming to a News feed where the context of Stream is set apart from this. If your interested in Stream, feel free to follow the [Stream Docs](https://puffstream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STREAM/overview).

Or, optionally read the below updates:

* Quote of the day: Do one thing really well and do it over and over again...

#### Better Developer set-up (DX) (5/04/17)
